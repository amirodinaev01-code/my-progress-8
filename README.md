Day 4: Memory & Pointers 🧠🔥
Today's focus: Pointer semantics, Stack vs Heap, and killing off redundant copies.

Summary: What I did: Full surgery on my old project. Switched to Pointers. No more useless clones — my functions now work with the original data. Efficiency is through the roof. 🏎️

Honest status: Figured out where my variables "live." Stack is for fast-food, Heap is for long-term storage controlled by the Garbage Collector. My code is smarter, but Go is as strict as a Tajik father — one mistake and it calls you out. 👔

Main enemy: My misunderstanding of Slices. Changing a copy of the "remote" doesn't change the TV. Now I know better.

P.S. Pro tip: Want to change the balance? Send the address (&), not the copy. Use a pointer, save the business. 💰🍔
